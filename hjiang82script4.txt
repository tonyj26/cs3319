-- Note this causes error because we can't delete agents that are attached to customers 
-- This is due to the NOT NULL we added for customer Table in File1 
-- So Regis Philbin, Rosie Cox, Courtney Cox, David Letterman, Rosie ODonnell and Tony Jiang not deleted because not from Springfield
-- Hugh Grant is not deleted because he is currently attached to Homer, Monty and Peter customers
